WORDLE TOO!

This is a clone of the popular NYT game 'Wordle' with one major difference: you can play as many times in a row as you want!

The NYT version of Wordle allows you to only play once per day, but this is Wordle Too and Wordle Too is infinite. This game is optimized for mobile browsers, and uses a combination of two RESTful APIs to get new words, as well as to validate guesses. Your stats are stored using your local storage and displayed after each round of play.

Wordle Too is fully deployed and playable at: https://wordle-too.vercel.app
